          <p>
            I&apos;m a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience building scalable web and mobile
            applications. Currently serving as AVP at Knight Fintech, I lead technology integration and platform
            consolidation initiatives following strategic acquisitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expertise lies in architecting and developing fintech solutions using modern technologies like Next.js,
            React, React Native, and GraphQL. I have a proven track record of scaling products from single-partner
            implementations to multi-lender platforms handling â‚¹1000+ crore loan books.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m passionate about performance optimization, developer experience, and building configuration-driven
            architectures that reduce integration time from weeks to days. I thrive in leadership roles where I can
            mentor teams while staying hands-on with code.
